Here's the code you will need for your Raspberry Pi Zero to be able to be used via USB (headless) which means you don't need a micro HDMI cable to conenct.

***config.txt***
dtoverlay=dwc2

***cmdline.txt*** #between rootwait and quiet
modules-load=dwc2,g_ether

***Create a file***
'ssh'


pi@raspberrypi.local

As an added bonus, I also show you how to setup and activate WiFi on the Raspberry Pi Zero W from the command line inside SSH over USB.

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

network={
  ssid="NETWORK"
  psk="PASSWORD"
}

sudo wpa_cli reconfigure
ifconfig wlan0
